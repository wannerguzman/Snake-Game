```
Just a simple Snake game create in java. I used eclplise IDE. I used the images for the 
head and the body of the snake. I also used umages for my frame and the obsticel the 
snake will be eating. In the frame the score and size of snake is shown. The game start
with a defult size of 3 and as you eat the apple the snakes size increases. When the snake
collapse with itself the game ends and you can press space to restart.
