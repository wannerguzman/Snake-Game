# Snake-Game
```
Just a simple Snake game create in java. I used eclipse IDE. I used images for the 
head and the body of the snake. I also used images for my frame title and the obstacle the 
snake will be eating. In the frame the score and size of snake is shown. The game starts
with a default size of 3 and as you eat the apple the snakes size increases. When the snake
collapse with itself the game ends and you can press space to restart.


```
# Java Classes
1. Main
```
Main is where I create the main frame for the game. Here I set the size of the frame, set 
the background color and make it visible and close when pressing x.
```
2. GamePlay
```
That were all the functionalities of the of the gameplay take place. For example, moving when
and arrow key is pressed and restarting the game when space is pressed. I also define how
the length changes.

```
